This module contains a series of wrappers for time series analysis work,
specifically for wavelet transforms (continuous (CWT) and cross (XWT), and for
calculating periodograms with red noise and confidence level lines.

The wavelet transform functionality is based on pycwt with some modifications to
improve functionality or agreement with the literature.
<https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt>

The periodogram functionality is based on the RedNoise_ConfidenceLevels Matlab
scripts.
<https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45539-rednoise_confidencelevels>

This directory contains an example Python script (example.py) that shows the
functionality of the included scripts. The tsaw directory contains tsaw.py,
which contains wrapper functions for pycwt, general helper functions, functions
for calculating periodograms and the related red noise and confidence levels,
and plotting functions.

The important functions are demonstrated in the example.py script. Specifically,
these include the cwt(), xwt(), plot_wt(), pdgram(), plot_pdgram(), and
detrend() functions.

To run this module, place a copy of the [tsaw] directory on the same path as
your python script and do 'import tsaw'. 

The plotting functions can be used as templates to create customized plots (e.g.
to create combined periodogram-CWT plots, to tile many XWT plots).
